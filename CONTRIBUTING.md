## Expectations

This community has a [code of conduct][file-code-of-conduct].
You must follow it when interacting with the community.

Be respectful and considerate when asking for things.
You are not entitled to free customer service.

Be friendly!
Be excellent to each other.

## Support

See [`support.md`][file-support] on how to get help.

## Contributions

There are several ways to contribute.

### Financial support

Support our efforts financially by opening the Sponsors tab in the
repository.


### Improve documentation

Fix that typo.
As a user you are perfect for helping us improve the docs.
Better explanations,
new examples,
etcetera.

### Improve issues

Help make issues easier to resolve.
Some issues lack information,
are not reproducible,
or are just incorrect.

### Give feedback on issues

Share your perspective.
We are often looking for more opinions,
insights,
and use cases.

### Write code

Contribute a test,
patch a bug,
add a feature.
Itâ€™s often good to first create a discussion or an issue before a pull request.
Perhaps thereâ€™s a reason things are the way they are.
Or thereâ€™s an alternative solution.

## Submitting an issue

* see [`support.md`][file-support] for help;
  the issue tracker is for issues
* search the Discussions and Issues tabs in the 
  repository before opening something,
  include links to what you find
* contribute a failing test if you can
* use the latest version of projects
* use a clear and descriptive title
* include as much information as possible
* be friendly!
* the more time you put into an issue,
  the easier it is to help you

## Submitting a pull request

* non-trivial things are often best discussed first,
  to prevent you from doing unnecessary work
* for ambitious tasks,
  try to get your work in front of the community for feedback as soon as
  possible
* do one thing and do it well,
  do not include unrelated changes
* include tests and documentation
* run `npm test` to make sure everythingâ€™s still fine
* write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
  itâ€™s your job to convince us
